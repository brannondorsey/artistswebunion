TODO:
+Implement number of API key call limit per day
+login and sign up
+make API not output anything if there are no get params
+add tried var to error statement to name what didn't return result
+algorithm currently treats no field entries as similar fields. This is correct but should not happen.
+add email confirmation column in database
+set session length based on stay logged in
+limit session variables stored to ONLY public api columns. Do this by using both PrivateAPI and API classes in Users class. Do authentication checks like loginâ€¦etc with PrivateAPI but only pass public API values into $_SESSION/$user->data.


COMPLETED:
-rewrite database class for better efficiency (i.e. keep a connection open. Perhaps pass in a reference to a global DB into classes that use it like API etc so that everything can use it) I DID THIS A FEW COMMITS AGO. I MADE THE DB STATIC.
-Design and make Algorithm class
