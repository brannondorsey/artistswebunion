##Todo for API Builder lib migration
- Remove InsertUpdate class
- Optimize ContentOutput class (should act as front end/back end proxy on all pages where content is delivered)
- Make an `api_config.inc.php` include file that has our database setup.
- Remove all instances of `API::query_results_as_array_of_JSON_objs()`
- Remove all instances of `API::output_objects()`
- Remove all instances of `API::get_error)()`
- Completely remove the old API and Database classes and replace them with the new ones
- Remove `Database::init_connection()` because it is included in the API constructor because it will be inside of the `api_config.inc.php`.

##Things to talk about
- Maybe actually display the badges they could use. From an interaction standpoint this could provide a faster way for a user to select the badge that works best for them.
