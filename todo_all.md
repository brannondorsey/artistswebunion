##Notes
- perhaps change "media" to something else. Art media is more like paint, charchoal, graphite, etc and could be confusing. Perhaps the word practice.
- Maybe on the forthcoming tags "more info" button on the register page we could give a suggestion to pick tags that describe their work, or the movements they would describe their work being assosciated with. I think that we want to make it as clear as possible how media and tags are different. Tags examples: installation, abstract, color field, dslr film making, large format, etc…
