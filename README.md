#The Artist's Web Union
##Abstract
The Artists Web Union (name pending) is an open sourced web development project that aims to archive and connect an extensive collection of independent artists websites. The project intends to give independent artist's websites the same virality perks that artists have access to when they host their websites through large web conglomerates like Cargo Collective, Carbonmade, Behance, and Wordpress. We hope to create an attractive and powerful database to explore unique homemade websites.

##How it Works
Participants add a small Artist's Web Union widget button to their site that links to their spot on artistswebunion.com. From there visitors can browse similar artist websites by mediums, locations, tags and thematic similarities. Visitors will also be able to explore each weeks most popular and featured artists websites as well as save the links to their favorites. We hope that the Artist's Web Union will act as a hub to connect artist websites together and make finding unique online artwork easier.

##Why are we doing this?
We are art students and we know a lot of artists and designers who build their own websites like us. We really love the freedom, creativity, and professionalism that comes with making our own websites but often wish that our sites had the same visitor traffic as sites made through large and more standardized artist website builders/hosters. We want to build a tool for ourselves and the artist community that can be used for our mutual benefit and that encourages more artists to experiment with their own online representation.  

##Sign up
Joining is free and easy! All you need to do is put our small widget badge on your website. When you fill out the info for the badge we will automatically create an account for you and add your website to our database so that more people can see your work.
